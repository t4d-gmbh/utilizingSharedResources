## Container

Containerization is a form of Virtualization that happens on the Operating System (OS) level - hence it is also known as _Operating-system-level virtualization_.
In containerization, the kernel of the OS allows the existence of isolated user-spaces.
A user-space is a dedicated address space or region that allows for memory protection, in particular preventing a software from interfering with the kernels address space.
