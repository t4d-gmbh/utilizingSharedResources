# Introduction to Concurrent Computing Concepts

You have likely encountered terms such as parallel processing, multi-threading, or multi-processing. To fully grasp these ideas, it is necessary to define *Concurrent computing*, *Process*, and *Thread*.

Concurrent computing is a cornerstone of computer science. Crucially, it is distinct from parallel computing.  To visualize the difference, consider this analogy: eating cake and singing a song are activities that can occur concurrently (by interleaving verses and bites), but they cannot happen in parallel (at the exact same instant).

For further reading, the Wikipedia entry on [Concurrent computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_computation) offers a broader overview.

## Key Concepts: Processes and Threads

The Wikipedia articles on [Process (computing)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing)) and [Thread (computing)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)) offer comprehensive introductions to these specific elements.

You do not need to memorize every technical detail presented there. Instead, focus on identifying the key information required to answer the questions in the upcoming unit's quiz.
