This technological capability inevitably led to an economic transformation: shareable resources are marketable.

When computing power is no longer tied to a specific box on a user's desk, it becomes a commodity.
For the provider, this shifts the goal from simply 'running programs' to maximizing utilization for profit.
Every idle CPU cycle or unused gigabyte of memory represents lost revenue.

By providing these resources as a service, the owner can monetize the system's excess capacity, earning fees from multiple tenants who buy exactly what they need, when they need it.
In this model, efficiency is no longer just an engineering metric—it is the direct driver of revenue.

While the concept of renting computing power dates back to the 1960s with 'Time-Sharing' and evolved into 'Application Service Providers' (ASP) in the 1990s, the modern term 'Software as a Service' (SaaS) was officially coined in a February 2001 internal document by the Software & Information Industry Association (SIIA).

Since then, the 'As a Service' paradigm has become the dominant economic model for computing, shifting the industry's focus from selling machines (ownership) to selling outcomes (service).
