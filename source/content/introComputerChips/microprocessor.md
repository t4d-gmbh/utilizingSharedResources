**Microprocessor**:  
Computer's central processing unit (CPU) based on ICs

In 1970 the **first microprocessor chipset** (secretly) mass-produced for the U.S. Navy's F-14 Tomcat fighter jet.

The Intel 4004 was the **first single-chip microprocessor** widely available general purposes computer.

A Microprocessor is a computer processor where the data processing logic and control is included on a single integrated circuit (IC), effectively miniaturizing the Central Processing Unit (CPU) of a computer onto a single chip.

The MP944, developed by Garrett AiResearch for the U.S. Navy's F-14 Tomcat fighter jet, technically stands as the world's first microprocessor chipset, entering production in 1970.
Unlike modern microprocessors, it distributed its functions across six separate chips.
However, because it was a highly classified military project, its existence remained a secret until the declassification of the F-14's design in 1998.

Consequently, the Intel 4004, released in 1971, clocking at \~740kHz, is recognized to be the first commercially available single-chip microprocessor, effectively launching the personal computing revolution.

**A microprocessor is a Universal Turing Machine based on ICs.**

From a practical point of view, a microprocessor can be considered a Universal Turing Machine implemented on a silicon chip; given the right input, a microprocessor is capable of carrying out any algorithmic process.
