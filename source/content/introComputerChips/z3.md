The **first programmable, fully automatic digital computer** built in 1941.  

Used ~2.5K electromechanical relays operating at **5-10 Hz**.  

Working with a **binary** representation of floating-point numbers.

The Z3, completed by Konrad Zuse in 1941, was the world's first working, programmable, and fully automatic digital computer.
It was built using approximately 2,500 electromechanical relays that operated at a clock speed of 5–10 Hz.
It was a pioneering machine that used binary representation (floating-point numbers) rather than the decimal systems favored by many of its contemporaries.

**Was later (1998) proven to be a UTM.**

While it was originally designed to solve specific engineering problems like wing flutter in aircraft, it was later proven to be, in theory, a Universal Turing Machine.
This means that despite its mechanical nature and limited speed, the Z3 possessed the fundamental logical flexibility to implement any computable algorithm, provided it was given a long enough instruction tape.
