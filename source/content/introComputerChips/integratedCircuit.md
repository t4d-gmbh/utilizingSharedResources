**Integrated Circuit (IC):**  
Full electronic circuit, including a transistor, on a single semiconductor substrate.

The invention of an IC is accredited both to Kilby (1958) and Noyce (1959).

The metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (**MOSFET**) by Atalla and Kahng (1959) was a highly scalable, voltage based transistor.

An Integrated Circuit (IC) is a set of electronic circuits—including transistors, resistors, and capacitors—manufactured together on a single piece of semiconductor material (usually silicon), allowing complex functions to be performed by a compact chip rather than a board of individual components.  
The IC was invented both by Jack Kilby in 1958, using Germanium as semiconductor plate and by Robert Noyce in 1959, with a Silicon chip and by printing connections directly onto the chip.
This "planar process" was suitable for mass production and is the ancestor of how modern chips are produced.
Both ICs used current driven Bipolar Junction transistors (BJT) which were state of the art at that time.

**The planar design by Noyce and the MOSFET allowed to drastically scale down IC's.**

At the same time, Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng realized the first field-effect transistor, inventing the metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET).
MOSFETs are voltage based transistors consuming significantly less energy than BJTs while being much more scalable.

The combination of Noyce's planar IC design and MOSFETs laid the foundation of modern computer chips.
