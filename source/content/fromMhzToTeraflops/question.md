## How kept computational power growing?



{% if slide %}

{.centered}
After 2005 the **CPU clock speeds stagnated** at roughly 4 GHz after hitting the Power Wall and yet the **computational power kept on growing**.

With Dennard scaling hitting practical boundaries (the "Power Wall") around 2005, leading to the stagnation of CPU clock speeds at roughly 4 GHz it was by no means that we witnessed a stagnation in usable computing power.
In fact, the number of calculations computers were able to perform, kept on increasing almost as if the CPU clock speed had no influence on performance.
