Modern computational research brings transformative capabilities, but also introduces a range of practical challenges. These challenges stem from the fundamental characteristics of computational work: large data volumes, intensive processing requirements, complex workflows, and the need for transparency in scientific work.

Understanding why these challenges arise is the first step toward addressing them effectively. In this section, we examine the reality of computational project challenges across three main areas: resource limitations, task complexity, and reproducibility requirements.
